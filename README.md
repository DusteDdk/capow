# capow

Capow is a Windows program Rudy Rucker and his student have worked on off and on since 1994.  The idea is to create a lava-lamp-like realtime tweakable light-show, based on 1D and 2D continuous valued celluar automata modelled on linear and nonlinear wave equations, on reaction-diffusion rules, and on user programmable rules.

Download and unzip the program, run capow2017.exe, and load some of the paramater files supplied.  You might start by viewing the file called 2D Grid - Gnarly Computation (pattern).CAS
