Parameter and rule files for CAPOW. Theses come in three formates:
*.CA (one rule with parameters)
*.CAS (a set of 1 to 9 rules with parameters)
*.DLL (rule file code).
The older ones are included in the Release CAPOW package. Some of the newer ones are in extra_capow_files.zip.
And I'll be dumping newer ones into this parameter_files directory as time goes by.
